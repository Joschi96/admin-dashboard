# Admin Dashboard | Odin-Project
## Idea
The idea is to create an admin dashboard by utilizing the grid elements. Most parts of this page are built by grids.
Grids are the new feature introduced in my last lesson on the Odins Project.

## remarks
Some page elements do not have interactive features, like links, or hover/click-events. This is because the focus was laying on getting the grid layouts working.
I tried to make the layout flexible to the screen size. It will not work on mobile devices.
